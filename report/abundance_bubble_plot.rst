Abundance Bubble Plot

The Abundance Bubble Plot visualizes the distribution and abundance of genera linked to antimicrobial resistance genes.
Each bubble represents a genus-AMR gene pair, with the bubble size indicating the relative abundance.
The position of bubbles allows comparisons of genera and resistance genes across samples.

Use Case:

- Identify dominant genera associated with specific resistance genes

- Compare genus-level resistance profiles across samples

- Visualize complex relationships between microbiota and AMR
