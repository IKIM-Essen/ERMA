Abundance Bubble Plot

The Abundance Bubble Plot visualizes the distribution and abundance of genera linked to antimicrobial resistance genes.
Each bubble represents a genus-AMR gene pair, with the bubble size indicating the relative count of similarity search hits found for this genus-AMR pair per sample. 
The colour of the bubble indicates the number of assigned fusion reads after filtering.
The position of bubbles allows comparisons of genera and resistance genes across samples.

The bubble plot is generated once for every AMR with more than 100 total respective similarity search hits. For representability, only 20 genera are shown.
The choice of genera shown is either all overlapping genera if at least 10 of the top 20 taxa overlap over all samples, or the top genus iteratively over each sample until 20 are filled.
