Stacked bar abundance plot

The Interactive plot visualizes the relative abundance of genera per sample according to assigned fusion reads after filtration.

According to the 'min_abundance'-parameter in the config file, genera with a lower abundance than this threshold are binned to "Other".

If several AMR's are found with a Fusion Read count of more than 1% to the total, one plot is created per AMR.
