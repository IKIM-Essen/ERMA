MultiQC Report

The **MultiQC Report** provides a comprehensive overview of the quality control metrics across multiple samples in your workflow. It aggregates results from various tools and displays them in a single, easy-to-navigate report. This enables efficient identification of potential issues in sequencing data or the analysis pipeline.

Purpose:
================
The MultiQC report in this workflow helps:
- Summarize read quality, alignment statistics, and analysis metrics.
- Quickly identify samples with unusual or suboptimal results.
- Compare sequencing quality and processing consistency across multiple samples.

Parameters:
================
No specific configuration parameters are required for generating the MultiQC report. It automatically collects data from tools used in the workflow, such as FastQC, BLAST, and others.

Output:
================
The report provides interactive plots and tables summarizing key metrics, including:
- Read quality scores
- Per-sample coverage and depth
- Mapping efficiency and error rates

This summary is invaluable for validating sequencing quality before proceeding with downstream analysis.
