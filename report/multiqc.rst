MultiQC Report

The **MultiQC Report** provides a comprehensive overview of the quality control metrics across multiple samples in your workflow. It aggregates results from various tools and displays them in a single, easy-to-navigate report. This enables efficient identification of potential issues in sequencing data or the analysis pipeline.

The MultiQC report in this workflow helps:

- Summarize read quality, alignment statistics, and analysis metrics

- Quickly identify samples with unusual or suboptimal results

- Compare sequencing quality and processing consistency across multiple samples
