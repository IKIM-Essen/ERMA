Boxplot

The Boxplots display the distribution of one of the three parameters (E-value/Alignment Length/Percentage Identity) against resistance genes (ABR) and 16S rRNA genes across samples.
This plot helps evaluate confidence, with lower parameter value indicating more reliable matches.

Use Case:

- Compare alignment confidence for AMR and 16S genes

- Identify samples with strong resistance gene matches

- Evaluate filtering thresholds for sample quality
