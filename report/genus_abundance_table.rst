Genus Abundance Table

The Genus Abundance Table provides a detailed overview of genus-level taxonomic classification from the analyzed samples.
It quantifies the relative abundance of detected genera by aggregating the counts of reads assigned to each genus.

This plot helps identify dominant microbial taxa and their association with resistance genes by summarizing the presence of genera across samples.

Use Case:

- Explore the taxonomic composition of samples

- Compare microbial profiles between samples

- Understand the relationship between genera and antimicrobial resistance
