Genus Abundance Table

The Genus Abundance Table provides an extensive overview of sample-wise counts of AMR-genus hits found through similarity search and filtering. 
The table shows how many filtered ABR similarity hits are contributed to which genus. Additionally, the relative contribution to the total amount of filtered ABR similarity hits can be seen.

This table is meant as full-detailed data depiction. A more intuitive but less extensive depiction is given through the 'Identity-Read Count per Genus'-Plot.
