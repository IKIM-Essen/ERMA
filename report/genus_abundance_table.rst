Genus Abundance Table

The Genus Abundance Table provides an extensive overview of sample-wise counts of AMR-genus hits found through similarity search and filtering. 
The table shows how many filtered similarity hits are contributed to which genus and which AMR. Additionally, the relative hit count per genus to the total amount of filtered AMR similarity hits can be seen.

This table is meant as full-detailed data depiction. A more intuitive but less extensive depiction is given through the 'Identity-Read Count per Genus'-Plot.
