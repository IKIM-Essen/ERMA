Identity Read Count per Genus

The Identity Read Count per Genus plot shows the number of reads per genus, filtered by sequence identity.
This plot provides a high-level overview of the genera linked to antimicrobial resistance genes based on sequence similarity.

Use Case:

- Assess taxonomic classification reliability

- Identify genera with high similarity to resistance genes

- Compare genera linked to AMR across samples
