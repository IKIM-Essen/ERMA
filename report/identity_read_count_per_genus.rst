Identity-Read Count per Genus

The Identity-Read Count per Genus plot provides an intuitive overview of sample-wise counts of AMR-genus hits found through similarity search and filtering.
Additionally, a boxplot of the percentage identities of all hits per genus can be observed. 
For representability, this plot shows a maximum of 20 genera with the highest hit counts. For further details, the raw table is can be found with the name "Genera Abundance".
