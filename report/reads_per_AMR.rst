Reads per AMR Gene Family

The Reads per AMR Gene Family plot shows the number of reads mapped to each antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene family.
It provides insights into the prevalence of resistance genes within samples by displaying read counts per gene family.

Use Case:

- Quantify the abundance of resistance genes across samples

- Compare AMR gene prevalence between samples

- Detect dominant resistance mechanisms in the dataset
